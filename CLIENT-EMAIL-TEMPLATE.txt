Subject: DNS Configuration Required for Blaupunkt-ev.com Website Hosting

Dear Client,

We have completed the development of your Blaupunkt-ev.com website and it's ready for deployment. To make your website live, we need you to configure the following DNS settings with your domain registrar.

WEBSITE HOSTING SETUP
======================

Domain: Blaupunkt-ev.com
Hosting Platform: Netlify (Recommended)
SSL Certificate: Automatically provided by Netlify

DNS RECORDS TO ADD/UPDATE
=========================

A RECORDS (for root domain: blaupunkt-ev.com)
----------------------------------------------
Type: A
Name: @ (or leave blank for root domain)
Value: 75.2.60.5
TTL: 3600 (or Auto)

Type: A
Name: @ (or leave blank for root domain)
Value: 99.83.190.102
TTL: 3600 (or Auto)

CNAME RECORD (for www subdomain)
---------------------------------
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: [your-netlify-subdomain].netlify.app
TTL: 3600 (or Auto)

Note: We will provide the exact Netlify subdomain after deployment

IMPORTANT: EMAIL CONFIGURATION
===============================

Your existing MX records for Blaupunkt-ev.com should remain unchanged.
We understand you're using Blaupunkt-ev.com for your email services, and these DNS changes will only affect your website hosting, not your email delivery.

Current Email Setup (DO NOT CHANGE):
- Keep all existing MX records as they are
- Email functionality will continue to work normally
- Contact form submissions will be sent to: info@blaupunkt-ev.com

NEXT STEPS
==========

1. Add the DNS records listed above in your domain registrar's control panel
2. Do not modify any existing MX records for email
3. Notify us once the DNS changes are made (propagation takes 24-48 hours)
4. We will then deploy your website and provide the final Netlify subdomain for the CNAME record

WHERE TO MAKE THESE CHANGES
============================

Log into your domain registrar's control panel where you purchased Blaupunkt-ev.com:
- GoDaddy: Domain Manager → DNS Management
- Namecheap: Domain List → Manage → Advanced DNS
- Cloudflare: DNS → Records
- Other providers: Look for "DNS Management" or "DNS Zone Editor"

TECHNICAL NOTES
===============

- DNS propagation typically takes 24-48 hours globally
- Website will be served over HTTPS automatically
- Contact form will send emails from: noreply@blaupunkt-ev.com
- All form submissions will be delivered to: info@blaupunkt-ev.com
