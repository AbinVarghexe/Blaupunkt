# 🎉 GitHub Action Keep-Alive - Setup Complete!

## ✅ What Was Added

### 1. GitHub Action Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/keep-alive.yml`

**What it does:**
- Runs every 12 minutes (5 times per hour)
- Pings your Render backend health endpoint
- Prevents Render free tier from sleeping (15-min timeout)
- Completely automated and free

### 2. Health Check Endpoint
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/health`

**Added to:** `backend/mailserver.js`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T10:30:00.000Z",
  "message": "Backend is alive!"
}
```

**Tested:** ✅ Working locally on port 5000

## 🚀 How to Enable After Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Render
Follow `QUICK_START_DEPLOY.md` to deploy your backend first.

### Step 2: Update GitHub Action URL
Edit `.github/workflows/keep-alive.yml` (line 15):

**Replace:**
```yaml
https://blaupunkt-backend.onrender.com/api/health
```

**With your actual Render URL:**
```yaml
https://YOUR-ACTUAL-RENDER-URL.onrender.com/api/health
```

### Step 3: Commit and Push
```powershell
git add .github/workflows/keep-alive.yml
git commit -m "Update keep-alive URL with Render backend"
git push origin master
```

### Step 4: Verify It's Working
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Look for **Keep Render Backend Alive** workflow
4. Wait 12 minutes for first run (or trigger manually)
5. Check logs to see successful pings!
