# üö® SMTP Connection Timeout on Render

## Problem
```
Error: Connection timeout
code: 'ETIMEDOUT'
command: 'CONN'
```

**Root Cause:** Render's free tier blocks outbound SMTP connections on ports 465 and 587 for security reasons.

## ‚úÖ Solutions (Pick One)

### Solution 1: Use a Different Email Service (Recommended)

Render works better with these email services:

#### A. SendGrid (Free - 100 emails/day)
1. Sign up at [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
2. Get API key
3. Update Render environment:
   ```bash
   EMAIL_SERVICE=sendgrid
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key
   EMAIL_FROM=info@blaupunkt-ev.com
   EMAIL_TO=info@blaupunkt-ev.com
   ```

#### B. Mailgun (Free - 5000 emails/month)
1. Sign up at [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/)
2. Get API credentials
3. Update Render environment

#### C. Resend (Free - 100 emails/day)
1. Sign up at [Resend](https://resend.com/)
2. Get API key
3. Very simple API

### Solution 2: Upgrade Render to Paid Plan

**Starter Plan ($7/month):**
- No SMTP port restrictions
- Better performance
- No sleep time

Then SMTP will work as expected.

### Solution 3: Use Alternative Port (Try First!)

Some SMTP servers work on port 2525:

**Update in Render:**
```bash
SMTP_PORT=2525
```

**Or try port 25:**
```bash
SMTP_PORT=25
```

### Solution 4: Deploy Backend Elsewhere (Free Alternatives)

#### A. Railway
- No SMTP restrictions on free tier
- GitHub integration
- Same deployment process

#### B. Fly.io
- No SMTP restrictions
- Free tier includes 3 shared VMs
- Better for SMTP

#### C. Vercel Serverless (with email service)
- Deploy as serverless function
- Use SendGrid/Resend for email
- Very fast, global CDN

### Solution 5: Host Backend on Hostinger (Simplest!)

Since your frontend is already on Hostinger:

**Hostinger Node.js Hosting:**
1. Create Node.js app in hPanel
2. Upload backend code
3. No SMTP restrictions!
4. Update frontend API URL to Hostinger backend

## üéØ Recommended Approach

**Option A: Quick Fix (5 minutes)**
- Switch to SendGrid/Resend API
- Update backend to use API instead of SMTP
- Free tier is enough for contact forms

**Option B: Different Host (15 minutes)**
- Deploy backend to Railway or Fly.io instead
- Keep frontend on Hostinger
- SMTP will work without issues

**Option C: All on Hostinger (10 minutes)**
- Move backend to Hostinger Node.js hosting
- Everything in one place
- Simpler management

## üìù Implementation Guide for SendGrid

I can update the backend code to support SendGrid API:

### 1. Install SendGrid
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

### 2. Update Backend Code
Add SendGrid support as fallback when SMTP fails

### 3. Set Environment Variables
```bash
USE_SENDGRID=true
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 4. Email Still Sends to info@blaupunkt-ev.com
No change needed in frontend

## üöÄ What Should We Do?

**I recommend SendGrid** because:
- ‚úÖ Free (100 emails/day is plenty for contact forms)
- ‚úÖ Works on Render free tier
- ‚úÖ 5-minute setup
- ‚úÖ Very reliable
- ‚úÖ No code changes needed in frontend

**Alternative: Railway/Fly.io** if you want to keep SMTP:
- ‚úÖ Same deployment process as Render
- ‚úÖ No SMTP restrictions
- ‚úÖ Free tier available

Let me know which solution you prefer, and I'll implement it!

## üìä Comparison

| Solution | Cost | Setup Time | Complexity | Reliability |
|----------|------|------------|------------|-------------|
| SendGrid API | Free | 5 min | Low | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Railway | Free | 10 min | Medium | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Fly.io | Free | 15 min | Medium | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Render Paid | $7/mo | 1 min | Low | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Hostinger Backend | Included | 10 min | Medium | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Try Port 2525 | Free | 1 min | Low | ‚≠ê‚≠ê (may not work) |

## ‚ö° Quick Test: Try Port 2525 First

Before changing anything major, let's try port 2525:

1. Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí blaupunkt-backend ‚Üí Environment
2. Change `SMTP_PORT` from `465` to `2525`
3. Save and wait for redeploy
4. Test again

If that doesn't work, we'll switch to SendGrid.
