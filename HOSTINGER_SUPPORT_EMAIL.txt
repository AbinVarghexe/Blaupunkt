Subject: SMTP Access Blocked - Please Allowlist Backend Server IPs

---

Hello Hostinger Support Team,

I am experiencing connection timeouts when trying to connect to your SMTP server from my backend application.

**Issue Details:**
- Email Account: info@blaupunkt-ev.com
- SMTP Server: smtp.hostinger.com
- Port: 465 (SSL)
- Error: Connection timeout (ETIMEDOUT)

**My Backend Setup:**
- Hosted on: Render.com
- Purpose: Sending contact form emails from my website (blaupunkt-ev.com)

**Request:**
Please allowlist the following IP addresses/ranges for SMTP access:

Render.com Outbound IPs:
- 100.20.92.101
- 44.225.181.72
- 44.227.217.144
- 74.220.48.0/24
- 74.220.56.0/24

These IPs will be used by my backend server to send emails via the info@blaupunkt-ev.com account.

**Additional Information:**
- I have verified my SMTP credentials are correct
- Connection works from some locations but times out from others
- This appears to be an IP-based firewall restriction

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
