## 🚨 CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Add GitHub Secrets (REQUIRED!)

The deployment **WILL NOT WORK** until you add these secrets to GitHub:

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/AbinVarghexe/Blaupunkt/settings/secrets/actions

2. **Click:** "New repository secret"

3. **Add each of these 5 secrets:**

```
Secret 1:
Name: FTP_SERVER
Value: ftp://153.92.9.132

Secret 2:
Name: FTP_USERNAME
Value: u966003410

Secret 3:
Name: FTP_PASSWORD
Value: [Get from Hostinger - see instructions below]

Secret 4:
Name: VITE_WHATSAPP_NUMBER
Value: 971558882595

Secret 5:
Name: VITE_WHATSAPP_MESSAGE
Value: Hello! I would like to know more about your products.
```

### Step 2: Get FTP Password from Hostinger

1. **Log in to:** https://hpanel.hostinger.com
2. **Go to:** Files → FTP Accounts
3. **Click:** "Change FTP password" button
4. **Set a new password** (save it securely!)
5. **Add it to GitHub Secret** as `FTP_PASSWORD`

### Step 3: Test the Deployment

Once secrets are added:

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/AbinVarghexe/Blaupunkt/actions
2. **Click:** "🚀 Deploy to Hostinger" workflow
3. **Click:** "Run workflow" → Select "master" → "Run workflow"
4. **Watch it deploy** (takes 2-4 minutes)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If workflow fails with "FTP connection error":
- ✅ Check GitHub Secrets are added correctly
- ✅ Verify FTP password is correct
- ✅ Check all 5 secrets exist

### If build fails:
- ✅ Check `package.json` has build script
- ✅ Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
- ✅ Review GitHub Actions logs

### If website doesn't update:
- ✅ Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- ✅ Wait 2-3 minutes for server cache
- ✅ Check Hostinger File Manager → public_html
